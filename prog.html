        <h2 class="h3">SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>
        <p> There are many popular programming languages in use today, each with its own syntax, use cases, and
          benefits. Here are some of the most popular programming languages and a brief description of their syntax, use
          cases, and benefits:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <P>
              JavaScript was one of the key programming languages alongside HTML and CSS that helped build the internet.
              JavaScript was created in <strong> 1995 by Netscape</strong> <i>the company that released the famous
                Netscape Navigator browser,</i> to eliminate the crudeness of static web pages and add a pinch of
              dynamic behavior to them.

              Today, JavaScript has become a high-level multi-paradigm programming language that serves as the world’s
              top frontend programming language for the web, handling all the interactions offered by the webpages, such
              as pop-ups, alerts, events, and many more like them.</P>

            <h6> What this language is used for:</h6>

            <p> JavaScript is the perfect option if you want your app to run across a range of devices, such as
              smartphones, cloud, containers, micro-controllers, and on hundreds of browsers. For the server-side
              workloads, there’s Node.js, a proven JavaScript runtime that is being used by thousands of companies today
            </p>
            <h6>syntax</h6>
            <p> JavaScript uses curly braces and semicolons like Java, but it also has a functional programming style
              and supports dynamic typing. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Python</h4>
            <P> Developed by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in the<strong>1990s</strong>, the multi-purpose
              high-level Python has grown extremely fast over the years to become one of the most popular programming
              languages today.
              And the number one reason for Python’s popularity is its beginner-friendliness, which allows anyone, even
              individuals with no programming background, to pick up Python and start creating simple programs.

              But that’s not all. It also offers an exceptionally vast collection of packages and libraries that can
              play a key role in reducing the ETA for your projects, along with a strong community of like-minded
              developers that is eager to help.</p>

            <h6>What this language is used for:</h6>

            <p>Although Python can be used to build pretty much anything, it really shines when it comes to working on
              technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics. Python also proves to be
              useful for web development, creating enterprise applications, and GUIs for applications.</p>
            <h6>syntax</h6>
            <p>Python uses indentation and whitespace to define code blocks, rather than using curly braces or other
              delimiters.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p> Java has remained the de-facto programming language for building enterprise-grade applications for more
              than 20 years now.

              Created by Sun Microsystems’ James Gosling in 1995, the object-oriented programming language Java has been
              serving as a secure, reliable, and scalable tool for developers ever since.

              Some of the features offered by Java that make it more preferable than several other programming languages
              are its garbage collection capabilities, backward compatibility, platform independence via JVM,
              portability, and high performance.

              Java’s popularity can be seen clearly among the Fortune 500 members as 90% of them use Java to manage
              their business efficiently.</p>

            <h6>What this language is used for:</h6>

            <p>Apart from being used to develop robust business applications, Java has also been used extensively in
              Android, making it a prerequisite for Android developers. Java also allows developers to create apps for a
              range of industries, such as banking, electronic trading, e-commerce, as well as apps for distributed
              computing.</p>
            <h6>syntax</h6>
            <p> Java uses curly braces and semicolons to define code blocks and statements.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>c/c++</h3>
            <P>Believe it or not, the programming languages C/C++ were all the rage in the very <strong> late 20th
                century.</strong> Why?

              It’s because C and C++ are both very low-level programming languages, offering blazing fast performance,
              which is why they were and are still being used to develop operating systems, file systems, and other
              system-level applications.

              While C was released in the 70s by<strong>Dennis Ritchie</strong>, C++, an extension to C with classes and
              many other
              additions, such as object-oriented features, was released later by Bjarne Stroustrup in the mid-80s.

              Even after close to 50 years, both the programming languages are still being used to create rock-steady
              and some of the fastest applications of all times.</P>

            <h6>What this language is used for:</h6>

            <P> As C & C++ both offer full access to the underlying hardware, they have been used to create a wide
              variety of applications and platforms, such as system applications, real-time systems, IoT, embedded
              systems, games, cloud, containers, and more.</P>
            <h6>syntax</h6>
            <p> C++ is a low-level language that uses curly braces and semicolons like Java and JavaScript, but also
              allows for more direct manipulation of memory.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Php</h3>
            <p>Just like Python, PHP also came to fruition as a side project by <strong>Rasmus Lerdorf </strong> with
              the initial development dating back to the year <strong>1994</strong>

              Rasmus’s version of PHP was originally intended to help him maintain his personal homepage, but over the
              years, the project evolved to support web forms and databases.

              Today, PHP has become a general-purpose scripting language that’s being used around the globe, primarily
              for server-side web development. It is fast, simple, and is platform-independent, along with a large
              open-source software community.</p>

            <h6>What this language is used for:</h6>
            <p>A large number of companies are using PHP today to create tools like CMS (Content Management Systems),
              eCommerce platforms, and web applications. PHP also makes it extremely easy to create web pages in an
              instant.</p>
