        <h6 class="h4">TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h6>
        <p style: padding: 10px;>Tools and technologies in software development refer to the various software applications, frameworks,
          libraries, and other resources that developers use to create, test, and deploy software applications. These
          tools and technologies help developers automate tasks, improve productivity, and ensure the quality of the
          software applications they create. Some examples of tools and technologies in software development include
          integrated development environments (IDEs), version control systems (VCSs), testing frameworks, build tools,
          continuous integration (CI) tools, deployment tools, code review tools, and containerization tools.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6 class="h6">Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h6>
            <p>An Integrated Development Environment or IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive
              environment for software development. IDEs typically include features like code editing, debugging, and
              code completion, along with other tools that aid in the development process. Some popular IDEs include
              Eclipse, Visual Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6>Version Control Systems (VCSs):</h6>
            <p>A Version Control System or VCS is a software tool that helps developers track changes to source code and
              collaborate on software development projects. VCSs provide a way for developers to keep track of changes
              made to code over time and to manage multiple versions of a codebase. Some popular VCSs include Git,
              Subversion, and Mercurial.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6>Testing Frameworks:</h6>
            <p>Testing Frameworks are a set of tools and practices used to test software applications. These frameworks
              help automate the testing process, reduce testing time, and ensure that software applications are reliable
              and free from bugs. Some popular testing frameworks include JUnit, NUnit, and Selenium.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6>Build Tools:</h6>
            <p>Build Tools are software tools that automate the process of building and packaging software applications.
              These tools help developers compile source code into executable code, manage dependencies, and generate
              reports. Some popular build tools include Maven, Gradle, and Ant.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6>Continuous Integration (CI) Tools:</h6>
            <p>Continuous Integration Tools automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository.
              These tools help to catch errors early in the development process, improve code quality, and speed up the
              release process. Some popular CI tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI.

            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6>Deployment Tools:</h6>
            <p>Deployment Tools are software tools that automate the process of deploying software applications to
              production environments. These tools help developers streamline the deployment process, reduce downtime,
              and ensure that software applications are deployed securely. Some popular deployment tools include
              Ansible, Chef, and Puppet</p>

          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6>Code Review Tools:</h6>
            <P>Code Review Tools automate the process of reviewing code changes made by developers. These tools help to
              identify bugs, improve code quality, and ensure that code changes are consistent with coding standards.
              Some popular code review tools include Gerrit, Review Board, and Crucible.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item body3">
            <h6>Containerization Tools:</h6>
            <p>Containerization Tools help developers package software applications into containers. These containers
              provide a consistent runtime environment for applications and help to ensure that applications run
              reliably across different platforms. Some popular containerization tools include Docker, Kubernetes, and
              Mesos.</p>
